# Project Name "Can of Books"

### Lab 12

(https://trello.com/b/LFy4MWG2/book-lab)

**Version**: 1.8.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

**Author**: Brian Thornburg, Harvey Francois, Rey Mercado

## Overview
Today you will add the functionality for the user to create a book resource in the database or delete one. A book will be created from a form in React, and sent to the server where it will be saved into the database, and then returned to the front end to be displayed in the list of favorite books. You will then be able to delete that book with a click of a button, to have it instantly removed from the front end, with a request sent to back end for removal.

Feature Tasks - CREATE and DELETE of CRUD
See your team’s Trello board for this lab’s feature tasks.

 
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

03-01-2022 10:15pm - Change feature in progress.

## Estimates

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

Matt Rangel - Helped debug feature one create.

Ryan Gallaway Helped us focus on more essential tasks in lab twelve.

## Process: Professional Pairing Practice

Much of the work you will be doing in the industry will be in pairs. In order to best prepare you for this, you will be working with the same partner all week on this book app project.
Before you begin to even think about your application, take at least 30 minutes to make a team agreement with your partner. This is an essential step to ensure a peaceful and productive week. You MUST answer the following questions in your agreement and include it in your README’s “Collaboration” section:

### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate?
Brian is in Central and finishes 11pm Pacific Time (1am central) usually
Brian is available after lunch hour to 4, has a break 4-6pm Pacific Time, but is around after 6pm until 11pm PST, and usually not available until 9am start of class
Harvey is available anytime to communicate on slack
Rey is available anytime except for dinner 6pm-730pm, though can shorten this if needed. Mornings am available starting 6am.  Late night depends after 10pm, can go longer if needed.
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Brian prefers using slack, then email if slack not getting a response
Rey prefers slack first, then email if slack not getting a response
Harvey :  “Slack works for me.”
How often will you take breaks?
Rey can take a 10min break every hour or 10 min every two hours
Breaks every hour for 10 min.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Ask TA’s for advice/assistance
Timely communication with group members
If needed ask Ryan
Possibly shorten or forego breaks per group agreement

### Cooperative

Make a list of each person’s strengths.
Rey

Good at facilitating communication

Harvey: 
“Not sure what my strengths are. I’ll let you know when I figure it out.” 
Sense of humor
Brian:
Styling, front-end design
Timeboxing daily schedule
Calm demeanor, good for team morale
Good at making an effort
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Harvey:

Brian:

General server and database knowledge
Get more of a feel for working in teamsMee
Rey
Timeboxing, 
Improving overall knowledge and speed to finish tasks sooner
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
“Pair programming, everyone gets a turn. ”-plan with 3 people is only one still drives… one is primary navigator, and one is secondary navigator- alternate once an hour on average or at logical end of task
Team meeting at start and end of day where we address what each has done, if there is anything we didn’t get to, clarification on things, what the plan is to do next. A few minutes for each person.

“I will say if you want to do the entire project, go ahead.” - Harvey
Call for emergency group meeting to problem solve issue
Make sure person who is causing the issue is informed by the other members letting him know

-How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
“I’m not the best at react so I'm going to need the help.” - Harvey 
Seek advice of instructor and/or ta on how to mitigate
Promise to be patient to each other
Pose questions to other team members on what the purpose of pieces of code are
